## Challenge ##

An emerging trend is that new applications tend to generate data 
in very **high dimensions** for which traditional methodologies of cluster analysis 
do not work well. Remedies include dimension reduction(PCA, SOMs) and feature  
transformation, but it is a challenge to develop effective instantiations of 
these remedies in the high-dimensional clustering setting.

## PCA ##

PCA is _not_ a clustering method and also _not_ necessarily a method primrily.
Many research use it to reduce dimensionality but it might not be bset as it 
is a **linear** and **parametric**, **nonlinear** and **nonparametric** method 
should not be ignored.

## [t-SNE](http://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/)  ##

t-SNE is _not_ a clustering technique. It can be used to embed high-dimensional 
data into low dimensions.
